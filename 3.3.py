Imagine a stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple. Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some threhold. Implement a data structure SetOf Stacks that mimics new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity. SetOfStacks.push() and SetOfStacks.pop() should behave indentically to a single stack(that is, pop() should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
FOLLOW UP
Implement a function popAt(int index) which performs a pop operation on a specific sub-stack.
